# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview

Welcome to my Rock Paper Scissors project repository. This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, designed to be a fun and educational coding exercise. The primary objective of this project is to showcase my ability to create a functional game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to provide a reference point for future projects.

## Features

- **Single-Player Mode**: Play against the computer.
- **Game Interface**: A clear and intuitive user interface to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- **Random Computer Moves**: The computer makes a random move each turn.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically detects when the player or the computer wins, or if the game is a draw.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the player's and the computer's scores.
- **Restart Option**: Provides an option to restart the game and reset scores.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the game interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/abhimanyu0x/rock-paper-scissors.git
   cd rock-paper-scissors
   ```

2. **Run**: Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

3. **Gameplay**:
   - Select Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking the corresponding button.
   - The computer will randomly select its move.
   - The result (win, lose, or draw) will be displayed, and the scores will be updated accordingly.
   - Click the restart button to reset the game and scores.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the game.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the game interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I have gained experience in:

- **Web Development**: Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional web application.
- **Game Logic Implementation**: Understanding the logic required to create a turn-based game.
- **Event Handling**: Managing user interactions and updating the game state accordingly.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically updating the web page content based on user actions.

## Future Improvements

- **Advanced AI**: Implement a more sophisticated AI for different levels of difficulty.
- **Responsive Design**: Enhance the user interface to be fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
- **Animations**: Add animations to make the game more visually appealing.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Enable a multiplayer mode to play against another person online.
